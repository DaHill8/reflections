Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:Git created .git directory with its files that are needed to git to work here.
Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:Staging area contains only things that I want commit, so not all files in working directory, from repository is different that it only contains chnges in some files. I can work on all files in working directory but commit only some, for that we have staging area.
