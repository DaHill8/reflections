Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:When I want to have it public and ready for cooperation from other people. Or as a backup or as a central place if I want to work from more places.
Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:Because on remote there can be some changes that I dont want in my local Git.
Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A:Forks are like clones but only on GitHub - for copying somebodys work on GitHub to my account. Clones are any clone of repository from GitHub, another computer or locally.
  Branches are different paths for work on repository, when I want to implement something little bit different so master stays same I do a branch.
Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A:I can see diff before/without merging. For offline purposes.
